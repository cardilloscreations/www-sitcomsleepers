Sleep with the comfort of familiar voices and laughs from The Beverly Hillbillies, enhanced using special techniques that scientific studies have shown to improve sleep quality.

Psychologists suggest people enjoy falling asleep to sitcoms because it can provide a sense of comfort to hear familiar voices and laughter, but exposure to blue light from the display can be bad for sleep. So these "Sitcom Sleepers™" use a red light filter. The red light can help produce more melatonin, or at least not inhibit melatonin like blue light does.

These "Sitcom Sleepers™" also adjust the audio across all clips in the mix to help reduce peaks and normalize the volume. This allows you to set a volume that's comfortable for the entire session instead of each clip playing at a different level and disrupting your sleep.

See the [@BinauralBeatBank](https://www.youtube.com/@BinauralBeatBank) channel for an alternate version that includes Binaural Beats which can improve sleep quality.

Those who want a longer session can use the playlist instead.

𝐖𝐀𝐑𝐍𝐈𝐍𝐆𝐒 :
1. DO NOT LISTEN to these or any other Sleep Aids when driving, operating machinery, or performing any task that requires your full focus and attention. They affect everyone differently and can induce a meditative state in some people.
2. SEEK MEDICAL ADVICE before using these or any other Sleep Aids if you have any conditions that may be triggered in some way (e.g., Epileptic, Seizures, Pregnant, Pacemaker, Mind Altering Drugs).
3. LISTEN AT A COMFORTABLE LEVEL so you don't cause ear damage.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
𝐈𝐍𝐒𝐓𝐑𝐔𝐂𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍𝐒 :
1. Listen at a comfortable level that will not disrupt your sleep. Some episodes have music or sudden noises that still come through, and you don't want those sounds to wake you up.
2. Each mix is just long enough to help you fall asleep, and then get out of the way, so you can continue to sleep without disruption. If you prefer a longer session, use the playlist instead.
